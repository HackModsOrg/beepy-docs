Heyo!

A :b:epis motherboard needs some parts! Namely, a Pi Zero, a display, a Blackberry keyboard, and a battery.

## Screens

## Pi Zero

Zero W or Zero 2 W, we'll use the latter. https://rpilocator.com/ can help you find one near you!

## Keyboard

Blackberry Q20 replacement keyboard. There's a few on eBay/Amazon/Aliexpress, but please, first check for them locally in your country!

Here's [a link](https://www.ebay.com/itm/405153457651) (now out-of-stock) as a reference for "what exactly you need to get".

You can also buy a cheap/broken Blackberry Q20 and take it apart for its keyboard. In fact, that might be the cheapest possible option
for you - so, do check!

## Battery

Has to have a JST-PH two-pin connector, more than 2000mAh preferred. We'll be going for some 4000mAh ones from Amazon, brandname
- they don't quite fit, but they're alright. We don't yet have a solid recommendation here, but we'll keep you posted.
