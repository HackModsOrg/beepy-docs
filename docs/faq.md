# FAQ

### What's a Beepberry?

Beepberry is a portable computing device, with a beautiful high contrast, high resolution display, and a tactile keyboard + touchpad, it is the ultimate everyday hacking gadget.

Powered by the Raspberry Pi Zero W (or any other compatible SBCs), you can use it as a chat device (supporting all chat networks on Beeper e.g. iMessage/WhatsApp/Signal/etc. ), or use it as a hackable handheld cyberdeck, running any Linux application that runs on the Pi.

### What is Beeper?

Beeper is a universal chat app. Itâ€™s a single app to chat with friends on 15 different chat networks.

### Does it have LTE/4G/5G/LoRA/Zigbee/GPS/etc. connectivity?

Additional connectivity can be expanded via USB or GPIO ports.

### Does Beepberry come with a case?

No, but you can [3D print your own case](/docs/3D). We'll be offering a case soon. The Beepberry can also be used as is (with the addition of a rubber band).

### My Beepberry LED is always on

You may be running an older version of the firmware, follow these instructions to [**update the firmware**](/docs/getting-started#firmware-update).

### I just opened the box and have no idea what to do

First you need to follow the instructions to [flash an SD card with the OS](/docs/getting-started), then make sure the battery is charged by plugging in the USB C port and flipping the power switch. 

### Help, the screen is stuck displaying a very striking static pattern, even after I've flashed the SD card

Follow the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started#software-setup) guide and run the install script before the screen can display anything.

### I set my WiFi SSID and password in the Pi imager but it can't seem to connect

The Pi Zero W only supports 2.4GHz WiFi networks. Make sure you're not trying to connect to a 5GHz network.

### I prefer a white background with black text

You can invert the display mode by running `echo -e '\033[?5h' > /dev/tty1`. You can append this line to your .bashrc to set it as the default.
